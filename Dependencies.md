Obsidian supports a rich ecosystem of plugins. There is just one required plugin for this vault, but I do recommend several others. You may need to enable community plugins from your settings menu before you can view these plugins.
# Required
- [Dataview](obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview) - renders the "Issue List" template
# Recommended
 - [Outliner](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-outliner) - Easily move items within bulleted lists
 - [Linter](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-linter) - Define rules for how notes should look and enforce those rules automatically
 - [Paste URL into selection](obsidian://show-plugin?id=url-into-selection) - Inserts links into text when you paste text with an active selection
