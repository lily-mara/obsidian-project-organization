"You can use Templates to insert pre-defined snippets of text into your active note" ([Obsidian Help Page on Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates)). You can insert a template into your active note by using the "Insert Template" command from the `Cmd + P` menu, or by defining a [[Keyboard Shortcuts|Keyboard Shortcut]] for it.

In order for these templates to be picked up by the "Insert Template" command, they need to be in your "[template folder](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates#Set+your+template+folder)," which you can set from the settings menu > Core Plugins > Templates > Template Folder Location. This is correctly set for this vault, but you will need to ensure that when you move the template notes to your own vault, you move them to your template folder. If you don't have a template folder, you can just create an empty directory called "Templates" and set this as your template folder in your settings menu.

This vault has two templates within it. 

- [[Issue]] - used to convey a single problem/blocker that you run across while working on something
- [[Issue List]] - used at the project/concept level to show all issues that are related to that project/concept
